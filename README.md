Authors: Borislav Sabotinov, Sivaranjani Ravichandran, Sneha Sirnam, Sriram Putta    
- Source Code: https://github.com/TXST-SoftEng-RR1/cs5392-project
- Website: https://ctl-checker-pprkprkh4a-uc.a.run.app/

## Pre-requisites and Dependencies

- Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/     
- Node.js and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/    
- JavCC: https://javacc.github.io/javacc/

## Working with Git

1. Work off of a short-lived branch, acceptable names: 
- `feature/<name-of-feature>`
- `bugfix/<name>`
2. Pull before you push
- from your feature branch: 
`git pull origin development`
3. To check status: `git status`
4. To check branch: `git branch`

## Compile JJTree and JavaCC files for the CTL Parser

JJTree is a preprocessor included with JavaCC. 
The output of the jjt file must be ran through JavaCC to create the parser. 
JJTree constructs the parse tree from the bottom up. 
JavaCC, on the other hand, is a top-down parser. 

1. `jjtree CTLParser.jjt`
2. `javacc CTLParser.jj`

## Build the app

To view dependency tree: 
`mvn dependency:tree`

To build the application manually: 
`mvn clean package`    

You should see "BUILD SUCCESS" on the terminal and a `target` directory should be created under root.

## Run the app

After building the app 

1. `cd target`
2. `java -jar ctl-checker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
   The application should start
3. Navigate to localhost:8080/hello in a browser to test. 

You should see "CS5392 CTL Checker App says Hello World!"

## Viewing the API documentation
To view the available API endpoints and details about them:

Ensure the project is running.    
Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## Deploy the service to GCP
Note: cannot push image to root level `gcr.io/ctl-checker` directly.

Build Docker image: `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/ctl-checker/ctl-checker`   
- First time around, may receive prompt to enable cloudbuilds for the project
Deploy the image: `gcloud beta run deploy --image gcr.io/ctl-checker/ctl-checker`    
- First time around, may receive prompt to enable run for the project
  - Select [1] Cloud Run (fully managed) for the target platform
  - Select [23] us-central1 for the region
  - Press Enter to select the default for service name (movies)
